# A good commit message looks like the this:

# Header line: explaining the commit in one line

# Body of commit: A few lines explaining the changes in more detail,
# possibly some background on the issue fixed or feature added




# Where that header line really should be meaningful, and really should be
# just one line.  That header line is what is shown by tools like gitk and
# shortlog, and should summarize the change in one readable line of text,
# independently of the longer explanation.
